\begin{abstract}
Due to their nanometer-scale wavelengths, X-rays are well-suited for probing
atomic-scale structures.  This paper discusses advancements in X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and the impact of improved X-ray sources, including synchrotrons and X-ray
free-electron lasers (XFELs), on structural studies in physics, chemistry, and
biology. Topics include the historical context of XRD, Bragg's law, experimental
techniques, and modern computational analysis methods such as Fourier transform
analysis and Rietveld refinement.  Challenges in data acquisition and recent
technological developments will also be explored.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been instrumental in elucidating atomic structures
since its experimental validation in 1912.  With the advent of synchrotrons and
XFELs, the technique has undergone significant refinement, enabling
time-resolved imaging and single-particle studies.

\section{Theoretical Framework} \label{sec:theory}
\subsection{Bragg's Law}
Shortly after Röntgen's discovery of X-rays, Max von Laue suggested that X-rays
could be diffracted by crystals, which Friedrich and Knipping experimentally
confirmed in 1912. The underlying principle was formalized by W. H. Bragg and W.
L. Bragg through:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bragg}
  2d\sin\theta = n\lambda,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the regular spacing between the atoms, $\theta$ the angle of
incidence, $n$ an integer, and $\lambda$ the X-ray wavelength \cite{Bragg1913}.
As an X-ray beam incident upon a crystal interacts with the electrons of the
lattice's atoms, it is scattered spherically in all directions. The scattered
X-rays from adjacent atoms interfere constructively and destructively, producing
a diffracted beam. The condition for constructive interference is given by Eq.
\ref{eq:bragg}. That is, when the path difference between two adjacent rays
($2d\sin\theta$) is an integer multiple of the wavelength, the waves will
superimpose in phase, leading to peaks in the diffracted intensity. This
phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:Laue}.

\subsection{The Structure of Crystals}
The theory of crystals and how they are structured is essential to understanding
X-ray diffraction. Crystals are regular arrangements of atoms in three
dimensions, exhibiting translational symmetry. The discrete points at which the
atoms of a crystal are located can be described mathematically by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lattice}
    \mathbf{R} = n_1\mathbf{a}_1 + n_2\mathbf{a}_2 + n_3\mathbf{a}_3,   
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{a}_1$, $\mathbf{a}_2$, and $\mathbf{a}_3$ are the primitive
vectors of the lattice and $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$ are integers. This infinite
set of points defined by Eq. \ref{eq:lattice} forms a Bravais lattice, and the
parallelepiped comprised of these primitive vectors is called the unit cell. The
constraint that crystals exhibit translational symmetry and repeat periodically
in space leads to the classification of Bravais lattices into 14 distinct types
\cite{lattice_types}.  These lattices can be further categorized into seven
crystal systems based on the symmetry of the unit cell. The seven crystal
systems are cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, hexagonal, rhombohedral,
monoclinic, and triclinic. The concept of a reciprocal lattice, which is
especially useful in X-ray diffraction, is defined as the set of all wave
vectors $\mathbf{k}$ that yield plane waves with the periodicity of the Bravais
lattice \cite{Ashcroft}.  The reciprocal lattice itself is spanned by three
primitive vectors $\mathbf{b}_1$, $\mathbf{b}_2$, and $\mathbf{b}_3$ which can
be generated from the lattice's primitive vectors via:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reciprocal}
    \mathbf{b_i} = 2\pi \frac{\mathbf{a}_j \times \mathbf{a}_k}
    {\mathbf{a_i} \cdot (\mathbf{a}_j \times \mathbf{a}_k)},
\end{equation}

For any cyclic permutation of ${i,j,k} = {1, 2, 3}$. The triple scalar product
in the denominator is physically interpreted as the volume of the unit cell. The
factor of $2\pi$ ensures that the reciprocal lattice vectors are properly scaled
so that plane waves match the periodicity of the crystal. The reciprocal lattice
vector is then defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reciprocal_vector}
    \mathbf{G} = h\mathbf{b}_1 + k\mathbf{b}_2 + l\mathbf{b}_3,
\end{equation}

where $h$, $k$, and $l$ are integers, commonly known as the Miller indices.
$\mathbf{G}$ is perpendicular to the family of planes indexed by $(hkl)$, these
being the planes that diffract the incident X-rays.  The inter-planar
spacing $d$ for a cubic crystal, for example,
is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:interplanar}
    d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}},
\end{equation}

where $a$ is the lattice parameter, which represents the length of the unit
cell's sides.  For a cubic crystal, we have $a = |\textbf{a}_1| = |\textbf{a}_2|
= |\textbf{a}_3|$.  For other crystal systems (e.g., tetragonal, orthorhombic),
the interplanar spacing depends on a more general relation between the Miller
indices, the lattice parameters, and the metric tensor of the crystal system
\cite{Liu2020}.





\section{Experimental Methods} \label{sec:experiment}
\subsection{X-ray Sources}
Modern XRD experiments use high-brilliance sources such as synchrotrons and
XFELs to generate X-rays. X-ray sources are characterised by their brilliance,
which is the ratio of the intensity (photons per second) of the beam to its
spatial coherence, which is proportional to the product of the size
$(\text{m}^2)$, bandwidth and angular divergence of the beam.  The difference in
brilliance between XFELs and synchrotrons is drastic, with XFELs exhibiting
higher brilliance by several orders of magnitude due to their high peak power
and short pulse duration \cite{Baillet2014}. A comparison of the avberage
brilliance of XFEL and synchrotron facilities is shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:brilliance}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/XRaySourceBrilliance.png}
    \caption{Comparison of brilliance between synchrotrons and XFELs. XFELs
    exhibit higher brilliance due to their high peak power and short pulse
    duration \cite{Brilliance}.}
    \label{fig:brilliance}
\end{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/800px-Undulator.png}
    \caption{Undulator}
    \label{fig:Undulator}
\end{figure}

These sources operate in a similar manner, accelerating
electrons to relativistic speeds before channeling them through undulators to
produce X-rays. 









\section{Data Acquisition and Analysis} \label{sec:data}
Techniques such as Fourier transform analysis and Rietveld refinement allow for precise structural determination.

\section{Challenges and Future Prospects} \label{sec:challenges}
High facility costs and limited access remain key limitations. Advances in AI-driven data processing and compact XFELs
promise to expand accessibility.
