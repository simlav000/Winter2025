In this paper some recent improvements in the analysis of magnetic neutron powder diffraction data are discussed. After an introduction to the subject, the main formulas governing the analysis of the Bragg magnetic scattering are summarized and shortly discussed. Next, we discuss the method of profile fitting without a structural model to get precise integrated intensities and refine the propagation vector(s) of the magnetic structure. The simulated annealing approach for magnetic structure determination is briefly discussed and, finally, some features of the program FullProf concerning the magnetic structure refinement are presented and discussed. The different themes are illustrated with simple examples.}

abstract = {Intensity-correlation measurements allow access to nanostructural information on a range of ordered and disordered materials beyond traditional pair-correlation methods. In real space, this information can be expressed in terms of a pair-angle distribution function (PADF) which encodes three- and four-body distances and angles. To date, correlation-based techniques have not been applied to the analysis of microstructural effects, such as preferred orientation, which are typically investigated by texture analysis. Preferred orientation is regarded as a potential source of error in intensity-correlation experiments and complicates interpretation of the results. Here, the theory of preferred orientation in intensity-correlation techniques is developed, connecting it to the established theory of texture analysis. The preferred-orientation effect is found to scale with the number of crystalline domains in the beam, surpassing the nanostructural signal when the number of domains becomes large. Experimental demonstrations are presented of the orientation-dominant and nanostructure-dominant cases using PADF analysis. The results show that even minor deviations from uniform orientation produce the strongest angular correlation signals when the number of crystalline domains in the beam is large.}

For the purpose of this book focused on the use of X-ray FEL beams for the study of biological materials, the story begins with the availability of these novel sources to the scientific community as user facilities. Let us however take a quick step back and provide a brief historical background on what has led to the advent of X-ray FEL sources. This will be followed by a short description of the principles of operation of X-ray FELs and the breadth of their scientific use.",

The data acquisition systems at the Eu-XFEL  facility will have to cope with beam timing and data rates comparable to  those in particle physics experiments and employs similar components and  techniques. The prototype Large Pixel Detector under construction at the  STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory contains one Megapixel sensor elements  and is constructed out of 16 identical supermodules. A FEM card is mounted  on the rear of each supermodule and provides readout and control functions.  Each FEM is linked to the central data acquisition by a 10 Gbps optical  fibre data link running 10Gb UDP/IP protocols. In normal operation the LPD  detector will generate 10 GBytes/sec of processed data for every one  Megapixel of sensor area. This paper describes the design of the FEM and  experience with the first prototype cards.}
